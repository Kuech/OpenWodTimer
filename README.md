# OpenWodTimer

Simple timer app for CrossFitters with a weird obsession for open source (and burpees).

## Use

The app opens up to a clock that display the current time.
By clicking start the user can set 4 different workout mods :

* AMRAP
* For Time
* EMOM
* TABATTA

When Time is up, the user can either repeat the workout, set up a new timer or go back to the clock screen.
